# ideaboardz-voter
Python script to vote for cards automatically on threads using just the board ID

#### Usage

Update the variable, board_id with the one in the URL. 

```python ideaz.py```

Note: This will vote on all of the cards. Need to find a way for a user to select which cards they want to vote for. 
Currently it just votes on all of them.
